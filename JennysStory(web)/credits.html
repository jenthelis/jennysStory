	<h1>This book was created to inform youngsters about the dangers to eating junk food, more specifically; eating them most of the time on a week to week basis.</h1>
	<p>It's important to have variety in our diet and eat the proper meals that will ensure us a longer, happier and healthy life. Candy, chips, burgers and soda are good to have once in a while for a reason... their ingredients can cause some uh-ohs and tricks in your body that can make you feel sick figuratively and literally.</p>
	<p>So remember, you are what you eat. It is up to you and your body to either become healthy or become junk.</p>
