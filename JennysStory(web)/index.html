	<h1>About this special book!</h1>
	<br>
	<br>
	<p1>The story of Jenny is based off what some of us eat on a daily basis. Even though it's good to have something sweet, sugary, salty, oily or meaty, eating them on a daily basis can cause some serious problems later in life! Jenny does just that with her choices on what to eat.</p1>
